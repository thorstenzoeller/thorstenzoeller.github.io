    <h2>About Me</h2>

      of my life.</li>

      <li>I live in Frankfurt, Germany, with my wife and my small son.</li>
      <li>I am a vegetarian.</li>
      <li>I love freshly ground and brewed coffee, preferably prepared with a
      French Press.</li>
      <li>I practice Ashtanga yoga every day and have a love-hate relationship
        with it.

      (one example being this website).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About This Site</h2>

    <p>
      This site does not serve any definite purpose. I have it just for fun, and
      to share things I find interesting. It is neither focused on a single
      topic, nor guaranteed to get updated on a regular basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Technically, it is crafted entirely by hand. Not even a site
      generator is employed &ndash; just plain HTML files edited with nvi. I
      outline the reasons for this approach <a href="/new/">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub
      Pages</a>.

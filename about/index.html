    <h2>About This Site</h2>

    <p>
      This site does not serve any definite purpose. I have it just for fun, and
      to share things I find interesting. It is neither focused on a single
      topic, nor guaranteed to get updated on a regular basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Technically, it is crafted entirely by hand. Not even a site
      generator is employed &ndash; just plain HTML files edited with nvi. I
      outline the reasons for this approach <a href="/new/">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is:

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><p>I was born in Oberhausen, Germany, where I spent the first about 20
      years of my life.</p></li>

      <li><p>I studied physics and did my PhD in theoretical physics.</p></li>

      <li><p>I live in Frankfurt, Germany, with my wife and my small
      son.</p></li>

      <li><p>I am a vegetarian.</p></li>

      <li><p>I love freshly ground and brewed coffee, preferably prepared with a
      French Press.</p></li>

      <li><p>I practice Ashtanga yoga every day and have a love-hate
      relationship with it.</p> </li>

      <li><p>I love the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> operating
      system (see my <a href="/openbsd/">OpenBSD page</a>) and the vi editor
      (see my <a href="/vi">vi page</a>).</p></li>

      <li><p>I strive to keep things as simple as possible in most areas of my
      life (one example being this website).</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About This Site</h2>

    <p>
      This site does not serve any definite purpose. I have it just for fun, and
      to share things I find interesting. It is neither focused on a single
      topic, nor guaranteed to get updated on a regular basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Technically, it is crafted entirely by hand. Not even a site
      generator is employed &ndash; just plain HTML files edited with nvi. I
      outline the reasons for this approach <a href="/new/">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is:
    </p>

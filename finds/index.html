        Two very convenient shell aliases for copying the primary X selection to
        the system clipboard and vice versa:
        <pre><code>alias primary2clip='xsel -p | xsel -i -b'
          alias clip2primary='xsel -b | xsel -i -p'
        </code></pre>
        Alternatively, using <em>xclip</em> instead of <em>xsel</em>:
        <pre><code>alias primary2clip='xclip -o -selection primary | xclip -i -selection clipboard'
          alias clip2primary='xclip -o -selection clipboard | xclip -i -selection primary'
        </code></pre>

        Selection: Copy and Paste on Linux (Shallow Thoughts)</a> for more

        In recent years, I have become increasingly aware of the profound
        effects of walking.  Many ideas occur to me while walking, and to me,
        walking &ndash; especially in solitude in nature &ndash; is a very
        calming and contemplative activity.  <a

        Walking Fosters Creativity: Stanford Researchers Confirm What
        Philosophers and Writers Have Always Known</a> is another interesting
        article on this subject, focusing on the connection between walking and
        creativity.  In particular, it cites the wonderful book &ldquo;A
        Philosophy of Walking&rdquo; by Frédéric Gros.

        <p>&ldquo;...which components of what aspects of the many things making
        up our lives at any point are worth noting in some external fashion, and
        which can be left undocumented?&rdquo; &ndash; The question <a

        article <a

        <p><a href="https://craigmod.com/roden/059/">Roden 059 &ndash; Stupid
        Life Tricks</a> by Craig Mod contains a thoughtful piece on the
        ever-present distractions of our phones and their consequences &ndash; a
        pressing and, in my opinion, still underrated issue of our time.  In
        particular, it cites an expressive passage from the recent article <a
        href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/picturing-the-humanity-and-dread-of-the-infinite-scroll">Picturing
        the Humanity and Dread of the Infinite Scroll</a> by Jia Tolentino, and
        refers to an interesting Aziz Ansari interview, <a
        href="https://www.gq.com/story/aziz-ansari-gq-style-cover-story">Aziz
        Ansari on Quitting the Internet, Loneliness, and Season 3 of <em>Master
        of None</em></a>.  Finally, it mentions two great articles by Craig
        himself, <a
        href="https://www.wired.com/story/six-weeks-100s-miles-hours-glorious-boredom-japan/">The
        Glorious, Almost-Disconnected Boredom of My Walk in Japan</a> and <a

        <p>In recent years, I have become increasingly aware of the profound
        effects of walking.  Many ideas occur to me while walking, and to me,
        walking &ndash; especially in solitude in nature &ndash; is a very
        calming and contemplative activity.  <a

        Walking Fosters Creativity: Stanford Researchers Confirm What
        Philosophers and Writers Have Always Known</a> is another interesting
        article on this subject, focusing on the connection between walking and
        creativity.  In particular, it cites the wonderful book &ldquo;A
        Philosophy of Walking&rdquo; by Frédéric Gros.</p>

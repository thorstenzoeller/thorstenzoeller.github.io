    <h2>Pretended Intentionality</h2>

    <div class="date">2021-10-21</div>

    <p>I have recently become aware of an interesting &ndash; and somewhat
    concerning &ndash; behavior of mine in relation to my phone: In those spare
    moments when I am waiting for something, for instance, and the inevitable
    compulsion to check my phone arises, I often do manage to resist that urge.
    But after that first little victory over myself, something interesting
    happens: My mind, unable to accept that it is denied the diversion it so
    much craves, is trying to come up with suggestions for things that would be
    worth doing with my phone while waiting:<sup><a

    <p><i>What was it again that makes Ridge A such a special place?  Now would
    be a good time to head over to Wikipedia and check it out &ndash; after all,
    there is not much else you can do right now anyway!</i></p>

    <p><i>Which city in the world has the longest subway system, actually?
    Well, why not figure it out quickly?</p></i>

    <p><i>Let's check openbsd.org to find out whether the new OpenBSD release is
    already available.</i></p>

    <p>My mind <i>knows</i> that I am trying to control myself in order not to
    compusively check my phone for no obvious reason whatsoever.  And therefore,
    recognizing that just letting things run will not suffice this time, it
    becomes creative: Knowing that I am trying hard to act intentionally instead
    of compulsively and reflexive, it <i>makes me believe that I do in fact act
    intentionally</i> by rationalizing using my phone.</p>

    <p>And thus my mind gets hold of me.  It's the monkey mind at work.  But
    just like a real monkey, it is not just jumping around like crazy; it is
    also very clever and inventive.</p>

    <p>What is so perfidious about it is that my mind is tricking me into the
    very behavior I am trying to avoid by <em>convincing me that I am in fact
    avoiding it</em>.  Yet, this is all just another, albeit clever, strategy of
    my mind to run away from the slightest sign of boredom and instead indulge
    in distractions; that everlasting endeavor of the mind of not having to cope
    with the truly important things in life &ndash; or, at the least, of not
    having to <a href="https://zenhabits.net/alone/">sit alone in a quiet empty
    room</a>.</p>

    <p>The good thing is: Once you become aware of something you want to change,
    it becomes possible to actually change it.</p>

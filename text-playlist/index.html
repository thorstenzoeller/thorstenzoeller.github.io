    <h2>My Text Playlist</h2>

    <div class="date">2022-01-08</div>

    <p>This is my text playlist, a well-curated list of articles which are
    highly relevant to me and which I re-read back on a more or less regular
    basis.</p>

    <p>I stumbled across the idea of a text playlist when Leo Babauta shared <a
    href="https://leobabauta.com/pl/">his</a>; he in turn credits <a
    href="https://bobulate.com/post/595878510/text-playlist">Liz Danzico</a>,
    who references Frank Chimero (the link to his original text playlist seems
    to be broken).</p>

    <p>I like the concept of a text playlist, since it forces you to think about
    which of the many great articles and writings out there are not just
    interesting, but truly <i>essential</i> to you &ndash; those articles you
    seem to come back to over and over again.  The idea with a text playlist is
    to pare down all the great articles you come across to just those few really
    essential ones.  I encourage you to spend some time and create your own.</p>

    <p>So here is my current text playlist:</p>

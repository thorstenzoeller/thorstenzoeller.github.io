    <p>Things I use.</p>

    <h3>Hardware</h3>

    <p>
      I don't care too much about hardware, so this is a rather short list.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Medion AKOYA E4253</dt>
      <dd>
        My laptop and only computer. It's a rather cheap one, but fully
        sufficient for my modest needs.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Software</h3>

    <p>
      In general, I prefer tools which are leightweight and fast and do one
      thing well.  If I have to choose between two tools for a job, I will opt
      for the one which is more lightweight, has fewer dependencies, or which
      (being an OpenBSD user, see below) is part of OpenBSD base.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>After having used various Linux distributions for many years, I feel
        like I have finally found my (close to) perfect operating system.  It is
        small, clean and simple, and perfectly suits my needs.  It just
        <emph>feels</emph> right.</p>

        <p>While not all of the hardware inside the Medion AKOYA E4253 is
        currently supported by OpenBSD (in particular, <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwm.4">iwm(4)</a> does not support the
        Intel Wireless-AC 9462 internal WiFi adapter), it runs reasonably well
        on it altogether.  Here is my <a href="../dmesg_20211209.txt">dmesg</a>
        (OpenBSD 6.9).</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>nvi</dt>
      <dd>
        I was a <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> user for many years, but
        recently Vim started to feel too bloated to me.  Therefore, I switched
        to nvi and never looked back since then.  It turns out that many
        features I once thought were indispensable are in fact very easy to live
        without.  For instance, read <a
        href="http://linusakesson.net/programming/syntaxhighlighting/index.php">this</a>
        if you think you can't do without syntax highlighting (as I did), and <a
        href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118">this</a>
        if you think it is a drawback that (n)vi lacks all the features Vim has
        to offer (read it even if you don't).  The only thing I really miss is
        Unicode support, which is why I have to revert to nvi-iconv instead of
        being able to use the default version, <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/vi.1">vi(1)</a>, from OpenBSD base.
      </dd>

      <dt>cwm</dt>
      <dd>
        I have used many different window managers in the past, most recently <a
        href="https://xmonad.org/">xmonad</a>, which I was quite fond of (not
        the least because it is written in Haskell). <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/cwm.1">cwm(1)</a> is part of OpenBSD base,
        and I didn't even know it before I switched to OpenBSD.  Finally a
        window manager which is simple, minimalistic, effective and unobtrusive.
      </dd>

      <dt>ksh</dt>
      <dd>
        I spend a lot of time in the terminal, and OpenBSD's default shell <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1">ksh(1)</a> delivers everything I
        need.  Part of OpenBSD base.
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Since I spend a lot of time in the terminal, a terminal multiplexer is a
        must, and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> is the
        obvious choice.  Part of OpenBSD base.
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="https://mupdf.com/">MuPDF</a></dt>
      <dd>
        A fast and lightweight viewer for PDF files with vi-like keybindigs.
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="https://feh.finalrewind.org/">feh</a></dt>
      <dd>
        A fast and lightweight image viewer.
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffplay.html">FFplay</a></dt>
      <dd>
        I rarely need a media player, but if I do, I will use FFplay from the <a
        href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> multimedia framework.
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a>
      <dd>
        Asciidoctor is a very fast text processor for the AsciiDoc markup
        language written in Ruby.  It has great documentation and can directly
        generate PDF as output.  I haven't used traditional text processors in a
        long time, mainly for two reasons: First, there is no separation of form
        and content whatsoever, which implies that content written in some text
        processor is always bound inextricably to the text processor itself.
        And second, they are much too complex and bloated for my taste, and in
        almost every case employ a GUI.  Having used <a
        href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> a lot during my studies
        of physics &ndash; doubtless the best markup language and typesetting
        system for mathematical documentation &ndash;, it was also my first
        choice for creating other forms of documentation (like letters) for a
        long time.  LaTeX is not really lighweight though, and while it is
        practically indispensible for creating mathematical and physical
        documentation, it is overkill for my typical purposes these days.
        Therefore, I have come to use AsciiDoc in most situations, which
        involves little markup at all.
